[<ship1>] I swear to god..   If you scan me one more time! 
[\example]

[example]
[<ship1>] This is not the ship you are looking for.
[<ship2>] Oh shut up with your Star Wars nonsense. 
[\example]

[example]
[<ship1>] Scan finished. Be about your business!
[<ship2>] I WAS TRYING TO!
[\example]

[example]
[<stationname>] To the idiot who is trying to land on pad <landingpad>.   Its the wrong one.    Traffic control over.
[\example]

[example]
[<stationname>] <callsign> begin airlock transition, navigate right with greens to your right.
[<ship1>] Acknowledged. Right turn out of the airlock.

[<ship1>] <stationname> Tower, this is <callsign>, ready for Launch.
[<stationname>] <callsign> hold position at current landing pad. We are currently vectoring a Heavy Transport and holding all traffic.
[<ship2>] <othercallsign> heavy to <stationname> Tower, airlock transition complete, beginning landing sequence. 
[<stationname>] Acknowledged <othercallsign> heavy
[<ship2>] What a cute little ship. Did you make it all by yourself <callsign>?
[<ship1>] I made it out of Heavy Transport parts. Another landing like yours, and I'll have enough parts for another one.
[\example]

[example]
[<stationname>] Be advised. You are in a no fire zone. Stow your weapons immediately. Our weapons are stronger then yours.

[<ship1>] I really need to take a monster dump!
[<stationname>] Um...this is <stationname> space traffic control. You are on an open channel.
[<ship1>] Oh crap! Sorry about that.
[<ship2>] Haha Crap. Literally.
[<ship3>] The mood in here was gloomy until just now. Thanks for this!
[<stationname>] Keep the channel clear please.
[<ship4>] um...speaking of a clear channel...
[<ship1>] Funny...NOT!
[\example]

[example]
[<stationname>] <callsign>. You are cleared for Pad four if you have cargo, If you're light, pad six.
[<ship1>] I'll make it pad six then control. All I have on board is my wife and she's heavy but not that heavy.
[<stationname>] Not sure you should be sharing that information but you are cleared for pad six.
[<ship1>] Roger Control. Can you have medical assistance on standby? By the look on my wife's face, I'm going to need it.
[\example]

[example]
[<ship1>] <stationname> Control. What number am I in the landing pattern? 
[<stationname>] This is <stationname> control. By the time you land, you will be number one.
[<ship1>] Copy that.
[\example]

[example]
[<ship3>] Control, I’m inbound for repairs at <stationname>. Had a close call with an asteroid out near <starsystem>.
[<stationname>] Understood, <ship3>. Proceed to Docking Bay 8, and our techs will check you over.
[\example]

[example]
[<ship1>] Control, what’s with the line at <stationname>? I’ve been in queue forever.
[<stationname>] Apologies, <ship1>. VIP transport's taking priority.

[\example]

[example]
[<ship4>] <ship4> to Control. I think my ship’s AI just sighed at me. That’s… not normal, right?
[<stationname>] Confirming, <ship4>. That’s a negative on normal. Have you updated your firmware lately?
[<ship4>] I thought I did. Maybe it’s just tired of my jokes?
[<stationname>] Or maybe it’s trying to tell you to stop making them.
[\example]

[example]
[<ship2>] <ship2> to <stationname>. I’m in a bit of a pickle here. Can you send a tow?
[<stationname>] <ship2>, you’re not even supposed to be in this sector. What are you doing here?
[<ship2>] I was… exploring? Yeah, that’s it. Exploring.
[\example]

[example]
[<ship1>] <ship1> to Control. I’m carrying some delicate cargo and need special handling.
